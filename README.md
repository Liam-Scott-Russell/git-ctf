# DEVs Git CTF
## Introduction

Welcome to the DEVs git Capture the Flag (CTF) competition!

If you can read this, then you've probably already done most of the setup, but please read the next section to make sure.

### Setting Up

#### Git

To make sure that Git is installed, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
git --version
```

You should get back something like `git version 2.32.0`.

If you cannot run this command, please [install git on your machine](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

#### GitHub

Make sure that you have signed up for a [GitHub](https://github.com) account. This is required for the CTF (and probably for your degree at some point).

### Challenge Website

The CTF challenge will be run online at []().

The CTF will only start after the presentation, so the questions won't be live until then.

### Getting Help

There will be DEVs exec team members walking around, who can help with any questions that you may have.

Additionally, there are the resources from the slides, and anything you can find on Google.

### Hints

Some CTF challenges will offer hints for how to complete them. These hints will often come at a cost (points), but sometimes they are free, so it is worth checking.

A hint costs half the amount of points that completing the challenge would give you. e.g. an "Easy" challenge gives you 2 points, and it's hints will cost you 1 point.

## Flags

### What is a Flag?

A flag is simply a random string of 16 uppercase characters, e.g. `JWGDXBBHNSGDKMBL` (this isn't a valid flag, unfortunately).

The flags are hidden around this git repository, and the challenges describe how to earn these flags.

### Capturing Flags

Flags must be captured in order to earn points. The flags are captured by copy-and-pasting them into the appropriate field on the CTF website. Each challenge has a unique flag, so you'll have to complete each challenge in order to get the flags.

## Prizes

### Scoring

Capturing flags will grant you points, which give you a standing on the leaderboard.

The different challenges have different difficulty levels, which correspond to different amounts of points

* The 6 "Easy" challenges are worth 2 points each
* The 5 "Medium" challenges are worth 4 points each
* The 3 "Hard" challenges are worth between 6 and 10 points each

### Available Prizes
