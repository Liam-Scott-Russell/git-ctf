# Challenge 12

## Description

A commit has been lost somewhere in this repository ... Find it, and you'll find your flag.

### Setup

Run the `./linux.sh` script to generate the lost commit. If you're on Windows, you can run this using the `git bash` program that is installed with git.

On Linux, you may have to run `chmod +x ./linux.sh` to allow execution of the file.
