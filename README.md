# Challenge 9

## Description

This is a multi-step challenge! You're going to have to do the following:
1. Create a new branch **based off this branch** where the name is your university UPI (e.g. "hsco139").
2. On this branch, create a file called `email.txt`.
3. Insert your email into this file (the one you are using for git/GitHub)
4. Include this file in a commit, where the message is "Hello, world" (without quotes, but with the comma and case-sensitive).
5. Push this code up to the remote.
6. Receieve an email with the flag (on the email in the email.txt file). Make sure to check your spam folder.
